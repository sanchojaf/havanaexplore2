        We would like to give you some useful information for your stay in Cuba:

    <ol><li>	Always drink bottled water and avoid buying food on the street. You should only eat in restaurants.</li><li>In Cuba there are two currencies: CUC and CUP (1 CUC=25 CUP). You are going to need to exchange your money into CUC. If possible, avoid US Dollars because there is a 10% tax charged by the government on each US Dollar.  The best options would be Canadian Dollars, Pounds or Euros. You should exchange your money at a bank or at an Exchange House (CADECA). You will need at least one passport to exchange money at the bank.  </li><li>	Credit cards are accepted as long as they are not issued by US banks.  </li><li>You will have Internet access only at your hotel, or at the ETECSAÂ´s offices (Cuban Telephone Company).</li><li>	While in Cuba, you should leave all your documents (passport, etc.) in the safe box in your hotel room. For your identification on the streets, you only need the hotel card that identifies you as a guest. </li><li>You can only take to your country 50 Cuban cigars and 3 bottles of Cuban Rum per person. You should buy these products only in specialized stores, never to people on the streets. Before leaving the country, an airport tax of 25 CUC per person must be paid.</li></ol></p>
